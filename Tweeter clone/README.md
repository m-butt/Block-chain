I was given this as a project, however, I was new to blockchain and had many problems to get along with it
The code is not mine I have followed a youtube tutorial but there are a few changes that I made which you will also
face by following the video

The video I followed was at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhZDtKaMSAU

The problem with this was, the person uses the Online Test net block chain which is not used now, 
thus You can not deploy your contract and use its ABI through API calls

Furthermore, I was instructed to develop the app using local ganache blockchain along with truffle 

thus I followed another simple tutorial and integrate the first tutorial 

In other words, all the code was copied from 1 link and the API techniques to call the function of the 
contract and deployment on blockchain was done following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexP3Q4PJIw&ab_channel=CodeEater

so let's clear things up in a better way 

link 1 = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhZDtKaMSAU
link 2 = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UexP3Q4PJIw&ab_channel=CodeEater

For the front end and contract use the first link
For blockchain, meta mask connection, ABI generation, and contract deployment use the second link

I know its difficult to understand but once you start doing it, it will start making sense
